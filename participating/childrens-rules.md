* There will be three categories for the children:
  * 4-7 years (an adult must accompany the team around the course)
  * 8-11 years (an adult must accompany the team around the course)
  * 12-15 years
* Two races will be run; one for 4-7 and 8-11 year olds and a second for 12-15 year olds
* The races will start and finish at The John Barleycorn Public House
* The 4-7 and 8-11 year old age categories race involves **1 lap** of the children's route (as per map)
* The 12-15 year old category involves **2 laps** of the children's route (as per map)
* No one over the age of 15 is allowed to be a team member in any of the children's races, and if the two team member's ages fall into two different age groups categories we would expect the team to enter into the older of the two categories. 
* Competitors must be ready to race by 12:00
* There will be a standing start outside of the John Barleycorn Public House with grid position assigned by a lottery conducted on the day
* Teams to consist of two people only, one pushing and one driving/steering
* The pushing/driving position can be swapped multiple times at any point during the race. The vehicle must be stopped when this is done and not in a position, which blocks the way for other teams
* All participants are responsible for their own safety and their team member’s. They are responsible for their vehicles at all times and must be aware of other people and vehicles on the route
* In the 4-7 years and 8-11 years categories the adult accompanying the Soap Box is responsible for the team.
* Head protection is advised
* All participants enter the race at their own risk
* All participants are encouraged to wear fancy dress
* All participants must stick to the given route (as per map)
* All participants MUST wear their team number on their chest – clearly visible
* There will be awards for Best Fancy Dress, Race Winners and Runners Up
