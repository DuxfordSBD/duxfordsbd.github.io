It is with great pleasure we can confirm the [2024 Soap Box Derby race entries are now open]({{ "/participating/register" | absolute_url }}).

The 2024 derby will follow the same format as the 2023 event with 3 races on the day, two childrens races and the adult race. The first childrens race is for children aged 4 –7 or 8-11, these must have a responsible adult accompanying them throughout the race. The second childrens race is for children aged 12-15, they will complete two circuits of the childrens race route and do not require an adult to run with them.

The adults race has three categories: aged 16+, elite and veterans (55+). The elite category is for teams that have previously, or predict they will, complete the 1.4 mile race route in less than 10 minutes. Please ensure ages on the day are as per the general rules. All three races will start at the John Barleycorn. Entry costs are as follows:

- £5.00 per team for the childrens race
- £10.00 per team for the adults race

**Applications must be received by 31st August 2024.**

By entering you confirm that you will abide by our [general rules]({{ "/participating/rules" | absolute_url }}) and [childrens rules]({{ "/participating/childrens-rules" | absolute_url }}) or [adult rules]({{ "/participating/adult-rules" | absolute_url }}), depending on which race you will compete in.

We also want to encourage as much sponsorship of the competitors as possible so we have [new information on how to setup a Cancer Research Giving page and links to sponsorship forms]({{ "/participating/sponsorship" | absolute_url }}).
