After an amazing year and Soapbox Derby we are happy to announce our grand total. We presented a cheque for £8,284.30 in aid of Cancer Research UK to CRUK representative and Soap Box supporter Gill Burgess alongside event volunteers, contributors and the committee. After the event we had more charity donations coming in from our contactless payments increasing the total raised in 2024 to £9,193.30 bringing our grand total raised to £95,543.

Thank you to all of our supporters, volunteers, prize volunteers and amazing venue hosts Mario & Tracey at The Plough, Ian & Andrew at The John Barleycorn and Gary at Graystones.
