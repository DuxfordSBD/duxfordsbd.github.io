While we are bitterly disappointed to have had to make the decision to cancel the Derby race event again this year we are delighted to announce that Mario and Tracey at the Plough are going ahead with the music festival that they have organised for what would have been the afternoon of the race. 

Please join us from 2pm on Sunday 5th September at the Plough where there will be live music throughout the afternoon from [Master of None][1], [Leanne Rae][2] and Broken Silence. 

Those of you that attended the Derby in 2019 will remember the brilliant set from Master of None who cover music from acts as diverse as Dolly Parton, Kansas and Rick Astley in their own unique rockier style. We are thrilled that they have agreed to return to play two 45 minute sets for us again this year so make sure you bring your dancing shoes and join the party! Also playing two sets is the lovely Leanne Rae, a singer songwriter and performer of jazz/pop hitsfrom Cambridge. Leanne will be joined for her second set by the bassist of her band Wordly to play some upbeat dance and funk songs. Our final act is Broken Silence a duo made up of performers Matt and Callum who have agreed to come out of retirement for one day only to play for us. 

In addition to the music the Plough will be providing food, burgers and hotdogs as well as the legendary Plough kebab. A cocktail bar with Soap Box themed cocktails will be open in the wisdom hut in the beer garden so you don't have to miss any of the music while fteching your refresments! 

We will be drawing the winner of the Lucky Squares raffle (reserve you square in the Plough!), announcing the winners of the [Couch to Soap Box Derby][3] event and auctioning a couple of special items to the highest bidder.

Entry to the music festival is free although donations to the Soap Box Derby in support of Cancer Research UK will be welcome. Tracey, Mario and the entire team at the Plough have worked so hard putting this event together so please do come and show them some support and lets enjoy be able to get back together as a village and enjoy what will be a fantastic afternoon.
