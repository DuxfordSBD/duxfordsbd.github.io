We can announce that our 2022 race entries are now open. You can find our [general rules and construction]({{ "/participating/rules" | absolute_url }}), [childrens race]({{ "/participating/childrens-rules" | absolute_url }}) and [adult rules]({{ "/participating/adult-rules" | absolute_url }}) on our website.

Race entries can be submitted online through [our registration form]({{ "/participating/register" | absolute_url }}).

We are also on the lookout for volunteers to help on the day so if you don't want to race but do want to help please [fill out our volunteer form]({{ "/participating/volunteer" | absolute_url }}) and join us on the day.
