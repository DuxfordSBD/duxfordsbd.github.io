The greatest road race to hit Duxford returns for its 10th anniversary and we aim to make this our biggest and best event yet! We have set an ambitious total of bringing the total amount of money raised for Cancer Research UK by the Soap Box Derby since its inception to £100,000.00! 

To date we have raised £74,150 so we would need to raise over £25,000 in 2023. This is a massive target and if we are to have any hope of reaching it we are going to need your help and support. If you would like to get involved in any way, whether by joining the organising committee, helping out on race day or by running your own fundraising event we would love to hear from you through our [volunteer signup page]({{ "/participating/volunteer" | absolute_url }}) or drop us an email [through our contact page]({{ "/contact" | absolute_url }}). 

You can pre-register your interest to race by sending us an email through our [contact page]({{ "/contact" | absolute_url }}).

For now, pencil the date into your diaries. Keep an eye on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DuxfordSoapBoxDerby) and this site.
