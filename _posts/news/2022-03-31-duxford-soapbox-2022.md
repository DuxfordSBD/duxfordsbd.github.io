First the good news. After much deliberation we plan to run the 2022 soap box derby. To many of you this will be a huge relief. So spread the word.

You can pre-register your interest to race by sending us an email through our [contact page]({{ "/contact" | absolute_url }}).

As I am sure you can imagine, an event on the scale of the derby requires a lot of planning and hard work. If this year's event is to be a success, we are going to need your help. If you would like to get involved in any way, please have a look at our [volunteer signup page]({{ "/participating/volunteer" | absolute_url }}) or drop us an email [through our contact page]({{ "/contact" | absolute_url }}).

For now, pencil the date into your diaries. Keep an eye on our [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/DuxfordSoapBoxDerby) and this site.
