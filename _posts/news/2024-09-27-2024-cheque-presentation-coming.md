There are a lot of major events for the Soap Box Derby like the day itself but perhaps more importantly is the announcement of how much money we have raised in support of Cancer Research UK. Well you do not have to wait too long to find that answer out. Please join us at [The Duxford Plough (57-59 St Peter's St, Duxford)](https://g.co/kgs/8EEo2oF) on the 9th October at 7:30pm to be part of the celebrations.

We kindly invite all of our supporters from those of you who attended and supported us on the day, those who volunteered to help, participated in the races or our generous donators. Without your help the derby would not be a success. We cannot wait to have you there with us on the 9th.
