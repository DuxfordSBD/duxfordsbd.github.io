We can't wait to see you all again in August! To date the derby has donated £93,543 meaning this year should see us break the £100,000 mark but we cannot do it without you.

The 2025 derby will follow the same format as the 2024 event. There will be 3 races on the day, two childrens races and the adult race. The first childrens race is for children aged 4 –7 or 8-11, these must have a responsible adult accompanying them throughout the race. The second childrens race is for children aged 12-15, they will complete two circuits of the childrens race route and do not require an adult to run with them.

The adults race has three categories: aged 16+, elite and veterans (55+). The elite category is for teams that have previously, or predict they will, complete the 1.4 mile race route in less than 10 minutes. Please ensure ages on the day are as per the general rules,
