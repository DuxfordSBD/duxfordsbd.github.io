We apologise for the delay in officially announcing this year's total but the wait is worth it. We managed to raise £12,200 in aid of Cancer Research UK. Our cheque presentation evening at The Plough Duxford was attended by Cancer Research UK representivies Gill Burgess and Laura Holland alongside event volunteers, contributors and the committee. Many of whom remember the very first Soap Box Derby on the 5th October 2013. This year's fundraising efforts brings the total to £86,350. I do not think a single person would have expected to be anywhere near that total 10 years ago.

Thank you to all of our supporters, volunteers, prize volunteers and amazing venue hosts Mario & Tracey at The Plough, Ian & Andrew at The John Barleycorn and Gary at Graystones. You can find out about everyone who helped us [this year at our supporters thanks page]({% link pages/about/with-thanks-to.md %}).
