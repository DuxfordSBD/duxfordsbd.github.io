What an amazingly successful 2023 Duxford Soap Box Derby and a fitting event to commemorate our 10th year. We can reveal that Nic Hill and Scott Linsdell from Phill Hill's Army were the winners in the adults race and claiming the Phill Hill Cup! Their winning time was 8 minutes and 4 seconds. One second faster than last year's winning team but still 13 seconds slower than our course record which still stands at 7 minutes and 51 seconds.
