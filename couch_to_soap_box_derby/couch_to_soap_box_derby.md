## About Couch to Soap Box Derby

Couch to Soap Box Derby was a new event in Duxford in support of Cancer Research UK. After taking the hard decision to cancel the 2021  soap box derby, we wanted to run an event that captures the spirit of the derby but without the challenges that hosting the derby while in a pandemic posed. Starting the 1st of August through to the 5th September, we asked you to run the soap box derby route! The whole 1.4 miles (or 2.2km if you work in metric). Just so the younger ones didn't miss out, we designed a shorter off-road route specifically for children. 

This [website][results] tracked your times, told you how many times you’ve run the route and reports the fastest times overall.

## The 2021 Couch to Soap Box Derby
 
Entry to Couch to Soap Box Derby cost £10 per adult and £5 per child. All proceeds of “Couch to Soap Box Derby” went towards supporting Cancer Research UK and their valuable work. The person that ran the derby route the greatest number of times won a pair of Aftershokz Air headphones.
