# How to

## Update for a new year

1. Reformat the frontpage.html document to alter any callouts. Update the heading to the latest call to action
2. Create a post which will advertised the new derby
3. Search for any instance of the previous year, and replace with the next year if appropriate e.g. search for 2024, and replace with 2025 unless it was in reference to 2025
4. Update the rules, entry and terms of conditions to this year's date
5. Update the "with thanks to" page with everyone who helped in the previous year
6. Create a new Cancer Giving page for the new year so any links from this site will redirect to the new page
7. Update the raised total
8. Update the register.md page to say entries are not yet open
9. Update the committee page with any changes once they are confirmed

Commit the changes to a branch.

## Opening race entries

1. Create a post describing the race entries being open. Copy from the previous year e.g. `_posts/news/2024-03-31-duxford-soap-box-derby-2024.md`. Make sure to update the year
2. Create a programme of events like `programme-of-events0-2024.md`
3. Change `navigation.yml` to point to the new programme of events
4. Update `frontpage.html` with the fact that the entries are open
5. Create a new form for entries. Previous years used Google Forms but this has not worked well in the past, especially on mobile devices, and might need reviewing
6. Check terms and conditions of entry with CRUK
